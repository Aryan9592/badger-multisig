# badger-multisig

This repo is where all EVM multisig operations take place for the Badger DAO.

It relies heavily on [`ganache-cli`](https://docs.nethereum.com/en/latest/ethereum-and-clients/ganache-cli/), [`eth-brownie`](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie), [`gnosis-py`](https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis-py) and a custom developed evolution of [`ape-safe`](https://github.com/banteg/ape-safe); [`great-ape-safe`](https://github.com/gosuto-ai/great-ape-safe).

A good overview of all its tickets and their status can be found here: https://github.com/orgs/Badger-Finance/projects/25.
